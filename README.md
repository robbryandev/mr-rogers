## Tests

Describe: RogerArray.prototype.replace();

Test: Check if a number returns desired array replacements
Code:
  const num = 5;
  const numReplace = [1, 2, 3];
  const strReplace = ["Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?"];
  const replaceValues = new ReplaceObject(numReplace, strReplace);
  const rogers = new RogerArray(num.countArray(), replaceValues);
  rogers.replace();
Expected Output: [0, "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", 4, 5]

Test: Check if replace order breaks with numbers higher than 10
Code:
  const num = 14;
  const numReplace = [1, 2, 3];
  const strReplace = ["Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?"];
  const replaceValues = new ReplaceObject(numReplace, strReplace);
  const rogers = new RogerArray(num.countArray(), replaceValues);
  rogers.replace();
Expected Output: [0, "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "Beep!", "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", "Beep!"]
