## Tests

#### RogerArray.prototype.replace()

```
Test: Check if a number returns desired array replacements
Code:
  const num = 5;
  const numReplace = [1, 2, 3];
  const strReplace = ["Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?"];
  const replaceValues = new ReplaceObject(numReplace, strReplace);
  const rogers = new RogerArray(num.countArray(), replaceValues);
  rogers.replace();
Expected Output: [0, "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", 4, 5]
```

```
Test: Check if replace order breaks with numbers higher than 10
Code:
  const num = 14;
  const numReplace = [1, 2, 3];
  const strReplace = ["Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?"];
  const replaceValues = new ReplaceObject(numReplace, strReplace);
  const rogers = new RogerArray(num.countArray(), replaceValues);
  rogers.replace();
Expected Output: [0, "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "Beep!", "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", "Beep!"]
```

#### ReplaceObject.prototype.isValid()

```
Test: Check if a valid ReplaceObject passes
Code:
  const numReplace = [1, 2, 3];
  const strReplace = ["Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?"];
  const replaceValues = new ReplaceObject(numReplace, strReplace);
  replaceValues.isValid();
Expected Output: true
```

```
Test: Check if an invalid ReplaceObject passes
Code:
  const numReplace = [1, 2];
  const strReplace = ["Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?"];
  const replaceValues = new ReplaceObject(numReplace, strReplace);
  replaceValues.isValid();
Expected Output: false
```

#### String.prototype.parseInt()

```
Test: Check if a number in a string returns a number
Code:
  const test = "5";
  test.parseInt();
Expected Output: 5
```

```
Test: Check if a string returns 0 for a NaN string
Code:
  const test = "abc";
  test.parseInt();
Expected Output: 0;
```
